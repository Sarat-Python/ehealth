<!-- Lip Care -->

		<div style="margin: 25px;"><h2 style="text-align: center;"><b>Lip Care </b></h2>
		<p><strong>Lip care</strong> is an integral part of beauty regimen. It is so because the lip skin is very sensitive and tender. Consequently age easily leaves its mark. Proper lip care routine results in soft, supple and full lips.</p>
		<h3>Lip Gloss</h3>
		<p>For those who want a simpler appearance, glosses instead of lipsticks are a great alternative. They add luster, and are perfect for casual and semi-formal settings. Since a gloss makes look fuller, women with thicker ones should generally avoid using too much.</p>
		<p>A good gloss applied on top of your balm will give them a shimmering appearance, and highlight your face even if you have no makeup on. Give it a shot!</p>
		<h3>Lipsticks</h3>
		<p>Most of us go wrong when choosing a suitable lipstick color. Choosing the right shade is very critical. Indians with fair skin generally have more options. They can choose from brighter colors like pinks and peaches.
Those of us with darker skin look nicer in shades of coffee, or caramel. A good tone for your skin is one that is just a tad deeper than your natural lip color. It is a good idea to experiment with shades at a beauty salon or a cosmetics store before you buy these often expensive cosmetic products.</p>
	    <p>You can apply a shade on your lower lip to see if it is a little deeper than the natural color on your upper lip. If yes, you have found the perfect shade to get those perfect kissable and appealing lips.
The best way to apply it is after moisturizing them with a good balm. If you want to opt for a fuller look, a pencil can be used to outline. This should generally be a shade lighter than your lipstick. After you apply it, add some gloss over it if you like the shimmering appearance.
