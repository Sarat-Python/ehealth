		<p>More than a great wardrobe or a skilled hand with make-up, healthy glowing skin is the key to turning heads.</p>
		<h3>Sunscreen </h3>
		<p>Straightforward advice: Wear a broad-spectrum sunscreen that protects against both UVA and UVB rays with an SPF of 30 or higher, even on cloudy days, and reapply every two to three hours you’re outdoors. </p>
		<h3>Consider Retinoids</h3>
		<p>Dermatologists say that starting out slowly, applying a pea-sized amount of retinoid every second or third night can help your skin adjust to the powerful ingredient.
		Consider an over-the-counter cream, gel, or serum containing retinol. This nonprescription version of a retinoid works more gradually and gently but is still effective in rejuvenating your skin.</p>
		<h3>Keep Skincare Simple</h3>
		<p>“The products necessary for beautiful skin aren’t glamorous, and include a simple cleanser, sunscreen, moisturizer, and a retinoid or retinol.”</p>
		<p>What’s more, the simpler your skincare regimen, the more likely you are to stick with it.</p>
		<h3>Give Products Time to Work</h3>
		<p>Just as using a half dozen or more products at any one time can overload your skin with too many ingredients, so can changing the products you’re using every couple of weeks.</p>
		<p>And if your skin is reacting with swelling, redness, or burning to a new product you’ve tried, stop using it immediately.
		But in general, finish the entire tube or bottle of a skincare potion before you write it off as ineffective.</p>
		<h3>A Balanced Life Leads to Your Best Skin</h3>
		<p>Activities like yoga and meditation help keep stress in check, which in turn reduces the release of stress hormones that worsen conditions like acne, eczema, and rosacea.</p>
		<p>Meditating regularly may even make treatment more effective. In one study, people with psoriasis, a condition that causes itchy, scaly skin, listened to meditation tapes while they received ultraviolet light treatments. They healed four times as fast as non mediators.</p>
		<p>The key to gorgeous skin turns out to be a mix of science, common sense, overall good health habits, and a simple stick-to-it skincare regimen. The spinach smoothie is strictly optional.
